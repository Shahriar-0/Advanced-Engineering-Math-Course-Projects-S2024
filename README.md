## Introduction

Projects for advanced engineering math course at university of Tehran. The projects are written in matlab with focus on fourier series, fourier transform, and PDEs.

## CA1: Fourier Analysis

In this project at first we learned the basics of matlab and how to plot functions. Then we learned how to plot fourier series of a function. Then we applied an harmonic analysis and analyzed its usage in fourier series. Finally we learned how to plot fourier transform of a function and how to use it in signal processing and used that to change the frequency of a signal.

## CA2: PDEs

In this project we learned how to solve PDEs using matlab. We learned how to solve heat equation, wave equation, and laplace equation using finite difference method. We also learned how to solve Helmholtz equation using finite element method. All the results are plotted and analyzed.
